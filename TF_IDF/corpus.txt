we have been feeding our back yard squirrels for the fall and winter and we noticed that a few of them have missing fur one has a patch missing down his back and under both arms also another has some missing on his whole chest they are all eating and seem to have a good appetite
critters cannot stand the smell of human hair so sprinkling a barrier of hair clippings around your garden or lightly working it into the soil when you plant bulbs apparently does have some merit the whole thing kind of makes me laugh it never occurred to me that we are the ones that stink
spread some human hair around your vegetable and flower gardens this will scare the squirrels away because humans are predators of squirrels it is better if the hair hasnt been washed so the squirrels will easily pick up the human scent
1 you can sprinkle blood meal around your garden as well 2 don’t trap and relocate squirrels 3 this is a losing battle since the population of squirrels is extremely high 4 also if the animal is a female there is a high likelihood that you will remove her from babies that depend on her for survival
hair loss in squirrels can be caused by mange or fungal disease mange is a disease caused by microscopic mites that burrow under the skin the squirrel mange mite has been reported in both fox and gray squirrels there have been no reports of this type of mange being transmitted to humans or domestic pets
1 you can also scatter dog or human hair around your garden 2 one readers shares i used to have a problem with squirrels digging up my bulbs 3 now once in the spring and once in the fall i ask my hairdresser to save a big bag of hair for me 4 i lightly dig this into the soil
rabbit repellent human hair will keep rabbits out of your garden collect hair from your brushes and spread it around your garden via pioneer thinking natural mulch when woven into a mat it retains moisture it deters weeds in some instances it can actually reduce soil erosion via npr plant fertilizer
the biggest advantage of using fossil fuels is that they can be easily stored and transported from one place to another large reserves of coal are therefore taken from the coal mines to the industries which are acres away from the mines the petroleum is also taken to too far off power stations to produce energy fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy this is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative source
benefits of fossil fuels fossil fuels are basically the remains of animals and plants and these are good energy resources the three main fossil fuels are natural gas oil and coal fossil fuels are low in cost and are very important resources for our economy fossil fuels are used to generate electricity used as fuels for transportation
fossil fuels are energy resources that come from the remains of plants and animals these remains are millions of years old there are three fossil fuels petroleum oil natural gas and coal fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road they heat our homes and light up the night theyre the bedrock we base our energy mix on
advantages of fossil fuels a major advantage of fossil fuels is their capacity to generate huge amounts of electricity in just a single location fossil fuels are very easy to find when coal is used in power plants they are very cost effective coal is also in abundant supply transporting oil and gas to the power stations can be made through the use of pipes making it an easy task disadvantages of fossil fuels pollution is a major disadvantage of fossil fuels this is because they give off carbon dioxide when burned thereby causing a greenhouse effect this is also the main contributory factor to the global warming experienced by the earth today
benefits one of the biggest benefits of fossil fuels is their cost coal oil and natural gas are abundant right now and relatively inexpensive to drill or mine for in fact coal is the most plentiful fossil fuel and it is found over much of the world fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road they heat our homes and light up the night theyre the bedrock we base our energy mix on
fossil fuels also generate a lot of money and are a good source of revenue to many countries they also help related industries provide jobs for people across the globe which is good for the overall economy fossil fuels are used for both residential and commercial purposes the three main fossil fuels are natural gas oil and coal fossil fuels are low in cost and are very important resources for our economy fossil fuels are used to generate electricity used as fuels for transportation
1 easily available since these fossil fuels have been of such a great source of energy more and more extractions are going on every day the geologists all around the world are trying to find out mines of coals the pressure is even more as the population is increasing day by day fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy this is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative source
you have undoubtedly heard of fuels such as coal oil and natural gas these are the three main types of fossil fuels you rely on fossil fuels every day for such tasks as fueling your car and heating your home and its very likely that the electricity in your home comes from a power plant that uses fossil fuels lets review fossil fuels are sources of energy that formed from the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago pressure heat and time allow the organic matter to transform into one of the three major types of fossil fuels which are coal oil and natural gas
fossil fuels are sources of energy that have developed within the earth over millions of years because fossil fuelsoil natural gas and coaltake so long to form they are considered nonrenewable lets review fossil fuels are sources of energy that formed from the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago pressure heat and time allow the organic matter to transform into one of the three major types of fossil fuels which are coal oil and natural gas
apothem the apothem of a regular polygon is a segment drawn the center of the polygon that is the center of the circle which circumscribes the polygon to one side such that it is perpendicular to the side if a regular polygon has an area of a square units a perimeter of p units an apothem of a units then the area is onehalf the product of the perimeter and the apothem be careful with this formula though for a given apothem there is only one possible value of p
apothems the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides the apothem of a square is equal to half of the length of one side
apothem of a regular polygon definition a line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side try this adjust the polygon below by dragging any orange dot or alter the number of sides note the behavior of the apothem line shown in blue the word apothem can refer to the line itself or the length of that line so you can correctly say draw the apothem and the apothem is 4cm each formula below shows how to find the length of the apothem of a regular polygon use the formula that uses the facts you are given to start

the apothem is also the radius of the incircle of the polygon for a polygon of n sides there are n possible apothems all the same length of course the word apothem can refer to the line itself or the length of that line so you can correctly say draw the apothem and the apothem is 4cm each formula below shows how to find the length of the apothem of a regular polygon use the formula that uses the facts you are given to start
apothem of a hexagon the apothem of a regular polygon is a line segment from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides equivalently it is the line drawn from the center of the polygon that is perpendicular to one of its sides the word apothem can also refer to the length of that line segment because of this all the apothems in a polygon will be congruent for a regular pyramid which is a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon the apothem is the slant height of a lateral face that is the shortest distance from apex to base on a given face
for an equilateral triangle the apothem is equivalent to the line segment from the midpoint of a side to any of the triangles centers since an equilateral triangles centers coincide as a consequence of the definition because of this all the apothems in a polygon will be congruent for a regular pyramid which is a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon the apothem is the slant height of a lateral face that is the shortest distance from apex to base on a given face
given a circle the apothem is the perpendicular distance from the midpoint of a chord to the circle s center it is also equal to the radius minus the sagitta for a regular polygon the apothem simply is the distance from the center to a side ie the inradius of the polygon see also chord circular sector circular segment inradius radius regular polygon sagitta cite this as weisstein eric w apothem from mathworld a wolfram web resource
apothem is a line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side its also defined as radius of the incircle of the polygon for a regular polygon of n sides there are n possible apothems of same length if we assume a right angled triangle where the apothem is the adjacent side half the side of the polygon to be the opposite side and line joining the centre of the polygon and vertex of the polygon to be the hypotenuse lets assume the angle formed by adjacent side and hypotenuse to be \theta

computer hardware usually simply called hardware when a computing context is implicit is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system in contrast software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware software is any set of machinereadable instructions that directs a computers processor to perform specific operations a combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system
computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer such as the monitor mouse keyboard computer data storage hard disk drive hdd graphic cards sound cards memory motherboard and so on all of which are physical objects that are tangible in contrast software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware software is any set of machinereadable instructions that directs a computers processor to perform specific operations a combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system
computer hardware is the collection of physical parts of a computer system this includes the computer case monitor keyboard and mouse it also includes all the parts inside the computer case such as the hard disk drive motherboard video card and many others computer hardware is what you can physically touch
computer hardware definition hardware is a comprehensive term for all of the physical parts of a computer as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to acoomplish tasks
abbreviated as hw hardware is best described as any physical component of a computer system that contains a circuit board ics or other electronics a perfect example of hardware is the screen on which you are viewing this page without any hardware your computer would not exist and software could not be used the picture is a logitech webcam an example of an external hardware peripheral this hardware device allows users to take videos or pictures and transmit them over the internet
definitions a computer system consists of two major elements hardware and software computer hardware is the collection of all the parts you can physically touch computer software on the other hand is not something you can touch software is a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific operations this includes the computer case monitor keyboard and mouse it also includes all the parts inside the computer case such as the hard disk drive motherboard video card and many others computer hardware is what

like many other early information technologies edi was inspired by developments in military logistics the complexity of the 1948 berlin airlift required the development of concepts and methods to exchange sometimes over a 300 baud teletype modem vast quantities of data and information about transported goods in edi terminology inbound and outbound refer to the direction of transmission of an edi document in relation to a particular system not the direction of merchandise money or other things represented by the document
each term in the definition is significant to the understanding of how edi works computertocomputer – edi replaces postal mail fax and email while email is also an electronic approach the documents exchanged via email must still be handled by people rather than computers the most commonly used edi transaction sets in the transportation industry are 1 204 motor carrier load tender the shipper or 3pl via a tms sends this transaction set to yrc the carrier to request a shipment pickup
time is money and that’s never been more true than with companies in the logistics and distribution industries logistics service providers lsp and 3pl warehouses ensure that orders are shipped and invoiced painlessly by using an edi solution designed for your particular challenges – edihq™ edihq™ has customer data available in a userfriendly dashboard which tracks shipping orders and invoices at all stages of fulfillment in today’s fastpaced world responding quickly to changing customers or market dynamics is a competitive advantage
a thirdparty logistics provider abbreviated 3pl or sometimes tpl is a firm that provides service to its customers of outsourced or third party logistics services for part or all of their supply chain management functions
let’s back up a bit before we specifically address edi in transportation first we must understand and get on the same page of what is electronic data interchange or edi as it is not only used in the transportation industry the most commonly used edi transaction sets in the transportation industry are 1 204 motor carrier load tender the shipper or 3pl via a tms sends this transaction set to yrc the carrier to request a shipment pickup
e lectronic d ata i nterchange edi refers to the computertocomputer exchange between different companies via electronic communication channels at the beginning of edi 1970’s there were no standards for the data format when companies decided to establish edi with a business partner they agreed bilaterally which format to use to reduce this complexity and the efforts time and costs involved there where introduced the first standards in the 1980’s
edi can be transmitted using any methodology agreed to by the sender and recipient this includes a variety of technologies including modem asynchronous and synchronous ftp email http as1 as2 etc it is important to differentiate between the edi documents and the methods for transmitting them in edi terminology inbound and outbound refer to the direction of transmission of an edi document in relation to a particular system not the direction of merchandise money or other things represented by the document
edi is a standard format for exchanging business data between organisations by electronic means it is used to transfer electronic documents or business data from one computer system to another as an electronic equivalent for paperbased orders confirmation and invoices between trading partners some of the key advantages of edi include
what is edi basically it is the electronic exchange of business documents in a standardized format in the edi world these business documents are called transaction sets and the customers and carriers with whom you do business are trading partners most trucking software packages have the ability to send and receive edi in this format there are two basic methods for your computer to send or receive edi transactions with your partner’s computer direct communication and value added network van

some people ask why should marijuana be legalized but we should ask why should marijuana be illegal from a philosophical point of view individuals deserve the right to make choices for themselves the government only has a right to limit those choices if the individuals actions endanger someone else summary we would have more money to spend on important problems if marijuana were legal the third major reason that marijuana should be legal is because prohibition does not help the country in any way and causes a lot of problems
thus while marijuanabased medications should be available on a prescription basis from a pharmacy pot use should not be normalized and the marijuana drug should be illegal bob enyart is pastor of the denver bible church in arvada colorado please add a username to view or add comments regarding marijuana use or any moral question arguing right and wrong in todays society is especially difficult because a growing number of people reject absolute right and wrong
marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal drug in the us and around the world those who support its legalization for medical or for general use fail to recognize that the greatest costs of marijuana are not related to its prohibition they are the costs resulting from marijuana use itself many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug
the costs of legalizing marijuana would not only be financial new marijuana users would not be limited to adults if marijuana were legalized just as regulations on alcohol and tobacco do not prevent use by youth many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug
recreational use of marijuana will only lead to a greater degree of drug addiction in the united states once we legalize recreational use of marijuana it is a slippery slope towards the legalization of other illegal drugs that are more hard core because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post
why we should not legalize marijuana shares contrary to the beliefs of those who advocate the legalization of marijuana the current balanced restrictive and bipartisan drug policies of the united states are working reasonably well and they have contributed to reductions in the rate of marijuana use in our nation many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug
if the us were to legalize marijuana the number of marijuana users would increase today there are 152 million current marijuana users in comparison to 129 million alcohol users and 709 million tobacco users many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug
marijuana should not be made legal for recreational use because it will have drastic negative effects on the us economy persons who are under the influence of narcotics like marijuana are not able to function in a manner that allows them to perform daily tasks needed for a job because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post
in my personal opinion marijuana should be legalized for recreational use not only is it statistically the safest of any drug used in america or around the world it also has zero reported deaths from use because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post
subphylum chelicerata class arachnida spiders this group contains many familiar organisms including the spiders mites scorpions and ticks examine the large spider on the right again notice that there are two body regions a cephalothorax and an abdomen on the cephalothorax are two to four pairs of simple eyes
the class arachnida includes a diverse group of arthropods spiders scorpions ticks mites harvestmen and their cousins scientists describe over 75000 species of arachnids the majority of them spiders most arachnids are carnivorous typically preying on insects and terrestrial living on land
spiders belong to the phylum arthropoda along with insects and crustaceans the order of spiders araneae—together with scorpions harvestmen and the large order of mites and ticks—make up the class of arachnida spiders differ from other arachnids in having the body divided into cephalothorax and abdomen
the class araneae contains the spiders a large and fascinating group spiders have the typical arachnid characteristicseight legs pedipalps chelicerae and two major body regions however the chelicerae have lost the inside thumb and the outside hinged segment has become a fang
making the world better one answer at a time the class of a spider is arachnida spiders belong to the aracnid familly along with all the other types of spiders spiders are not insects they are arachnids so are scorpions mite ticks harvestmen and many others
accordingly the spider is placed in phylum arthropoda class classis arachnida order ordo araneae this order is further divided into 3 suborders the mygalomorphae the primitive spiders the aranaeomorphae the modern spiders and the mesothelae with one family of spiders the liphistiidae

1 the risk of reproductive cancers ovarian uterine mammarian for an unspayed female rabbit stands at is virtually eliminated by spaying your female rabbit 2 your neutered male rabbit will live longer as well given that he won’t be tempted to fight with other animals rabbits cats etc due to his sexual aggression spayneuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country the low end of the range can be as inexpensive as 5075 often in spayneuter clinics while vets in major metropolitan areas where rents and labor costs are very high often charge several hundred dollars see our veterinary listings
the cost of spaying your rabbit is going to greatly vary on a few different factors 1 in your less populated area where the cost of living is relatively low the prices can range anywhere from 85 to 200 2 on average most of your typical clinics are going to charge anywhere from 150 to 300 1 medications for a rabbit will start around 20 – 80 a shot such as a metacam shot may be required before the procedure begins 2 a shot such as this can cost upwards of 10 to 30 depending on the vet 3 the vet will more than likely want a follow up visit
what does the surgery cost spayneuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country the low end of the range can be as inexpensive as 5075 often in spayneuter clinics while vets in major metropolitan areas where rents and labor costs are very high often charge several hundred dollars see our veterinary listings
it is not cheap though expect around 100 for a neuter and 200 for a spay they need to use a different anesthesia for rabbits than with dogs and cats make sure you use a rabbit knowledgeable vet rabbits can make good pets for some people as long as you have realistic expectations rabbits can get pregnant at 13 weeks of age so keep them separate until spayed neutered female rabbits have a reproductive cancer rate near 85 so an unspayed female almost always lives a very short life
1 medications after the procedure is done will be necessary 2 medications for a rabbit will start around 20 – 80 a shot such as a metacam shot may be required before the procedure begins 3 a shot such as this can cost upwards of 10 to 30 depending on the vet 4 the vet will more than likely want a follow up visit 1 medications for a rabbit will start around 20 – 80 a shot such as a metacam shot may be required before the procedure begins 2 a shot such as this can cost upwards of 10 to 30 depending on the vet 3
in my neck of the woods it will cost you 140 230 at a vet this is typical however if you have a clinic or shelter that does lowcost spayneuter for rabbits then you may pay as little as 50 this is rare but worth the research to find one id suggesting making sure your male is actually a male and your female is a female if they are over six weeks old then you should be able to tell
the cost of neutering rabbits is normally around the same price as equivalent operations performed on cats – but it is worth checking this out with your vet as to how much they charge for male neutering and female spaying
how much does it cost to have a female rabbit spayed my dutch rabbit is about 8 12 months old and i know they are prone to uterine cancer i need to know how much it would cost to get her spayed somewhere in pinellas county fl and possibly where it would be cheapest
100 for a male 200 for a female if you can find a good vet who will do it at least thats what it is in my area it is great for their health but it is pricey theyre great pets who enjoy the company of another rabbit rabbits can get pregnant at 13 weeks of age so keep them separate until spayed neutered female rabbits have a reproductive cancer rate near 85 so an unspayed female almost always lives a very short life
1 spaying and neutering for rabbits has become a safe procedure when performed by experienced rabbit veterinarians 2 the house rabbit society has had over 1000 rabbits spayed or neutered with approximately 1 mortality due to anesthesia spayneuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country the low end of the range can be as inexpensive as 5075 often in spayneuter clinics while vets in major metropolitan areas where rents and labor costs are very high often charge several hundred dollars see our veterinary listings
