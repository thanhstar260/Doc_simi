In today's era, the Earth's environment is facing worrisome issues, such as air pollution and water pollution. The main causes of these problems are industrial development, population growth, and unsustainable use of resources. However, through measures like reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting environmental awareness, these issues can be effectively addressed. One of the primary causes of environmental pollution is industrial development. With the rapid growth of industries, harmful emissions are released into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution. Factories and power plants release pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, which not only degrade air quality but also contribute to global warming. Additionally, industrial waste is often discharged into rivers and oceans, causing water pollution and endangering aquatic ecosystems. Another factor that exacerbates environmental issues is the increase in population. The growing global population puts pressure on resources, leading to overconsumption and environmental degradation. As more people use vehicles and energy-intensive appliances, the demand for fossil fuels increases, resulting in higher levels of air pollution. Furthermore, the rising population leads to increased waste generation, straining waste management systems and polluting land and water bodies. To address these challenges, it is crucial to adopt sustainable practices and reduce dependence on non-renewable resources. Governments and industries should invest in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. Encouraging the use of public transportation and promoting cycling and walking can reduce vehicular emissions, thus mitigating air pollution. Moreover, implementing stricter regulations on industrial waste management and promoting recycling and wastewater treatment can significantly reduce water pollution. In addition to technological solutions, raising environmental awareness among individuals is essential. Education campaigns and public outreach programs can inform people about the consequences of pollution and encourage responsible behavior. By instilling a sense of environmental responsibility in individuals, we can promote sustainable lifestyles and reduce our impact on the environment. Governments, NGOs, and educational institutions should collaborate to incorporate environmental education into school curricula and organize community initiatives that focus on environmental conservation. In conclusion, the causes of environmental pollution, such as industrial development and population growth, pose significant challenges to the planet. However, by implementing measures such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels, promoting sustainable practices, and raising environmental awareness, we can tackle these issues effectively. It is crucial for governments, industries, and individuals to work together to protect and preserve our environment for future generations.
A blood blister is a type of blister that develops when blood vessels are damaged near the surface of the skin. Blood blisters form after a pinching or bruising injury that does not actually break the skin. Since the blood cannot escape through an open wound, it collects beneath a bubble unde, A blood blister is a specific type of blister that is due to damage to blood vessels and tissues just under the skin, which causes blood and other fluids to pool and form a bump.

We have been feeding our back yard squirrels for the fall and winter and we noticed that a few of them have missing fur one has a patch missing down his back and under both arms also another has some missing on his whole chest they are all eating and seem to have a good appetite. Critters cannot stand the smell of human hair so sprinkling a barrier of hair clippings around your garden or lightly working it into the soil when you plant bulbs apparently does have some merit the whole thing kind of makes me laugh it never occurred to me that we are the ones that stink
Spread some human hair around your vegetable and flower gardens this will scare the squirrels away because humans are predators of squirrels it is better if the hair hasnt been washed so the squirrels will easily pick up the human scent
Osprey, Pandion haliaetus, is a member of the Family Pandioninae. There is only one species of Osprey found worldwide. This fascinating raptor plunges into water for fish, the only raptor that does. Ospreys are medium-large raptor, measuring 21-24.5 inches long with a 4.5 to 6 foot wingspan., Eggs and incubation Female Ospreys begin to lay their eggs in late April. The eggs are beautifully blotched reddish-brown and are about the same size as a large hens’ egg. They are produced at two-day intervals: Novice breeders will usually lay two eggs; experienced pairs lay three or very occasionally four., The average turkey will lay 110 to 115 eggs in a 28/30 week period. The gobbler's sperm is stored in the hen's oviduct, so that fertilized eggs may be laid up to fo … ur weeks after mating., The osprey typically mates for life. It usually lays two to four eggs within a month. It typically takes about five weeks for the osprey's eggs to hatch., Osprey Facts. Breeding Age at first breeding: 3-5 years Number of eggs: Usually 3 Size of eggs (mm): 62 x 46 Incubation period: 35-42 days Fledging period: 53 days. First migration By late August or early September, the young Ospreys leave their nest sites and head south on their first migration., They will usually lay an egg each day up to about 5-7 eggs. Depending on when the hen begins to incubate them in earnest (usually after the second or third egg is laid) you can expect them to begin hatching after about 15-17 days. You will need to beef up their diet and begin feeding them some soft foods.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has published 2014 rates and other revisions for the home health agency (HHA) prospective payment system (PPS). 1 The base fee per 60-day episode in 2014 will be $2,869 (prior to geographic adjustment), a decrease by an average of 1%, with a 3% add-on for rural HHAs. 1 The 2014 per-visit rate, known as low-utilization payment adjustment (LUPA), is $143.88 for speech-language pathologists (SLPs), compared with $132.40 for physical therapists (PT) and $133.30 for occupational therapists (OT), geographically adjusted., 1 Kathe Wallace Physical Therapy in Washington charges $165-$205 for a one-hour initial evaluation, $112 for appointments less than 45 minutes and $150 for a session of 50 to 55 minutes. 1 Physical therapy typically is covered by health insurance when medically necessary. 2 For patients not covered by health insurance, physical therapy typically costs $50-$350 or more per session, depending on the length of the session, the service provided during the session and the provider., 1 For patients not covered by health insurance, physical therapy typically costs $50-$350 or more per session, depending on the length of the session, the service provided during the session and the provider. 1 Physical therapy typically is covered by health insurance when medically necessary. 2 For patients not covered by health insurance, physical therapy typically costs $50-$350 or more per session, depending on the length of the session, the service provided during the session and the provider., Without insurance, the cost will depend both on the services you require and how willing your physical therapist is to work with you on payment and therapy structure. According to national benchmarks, physical therapists deliver an average of 3.4 weighted procedures during a physical therapy visit. As a cash patient, you can negotiate rates with the therapist. Ask for a discount equal to average insurance write offs, and let the company know that you’ll pay cash up front so they can save money in the billing process. A service that is charged at $100 may only cost you $50 when you pay in cash., The average Medicare allowable for services is between $26 and $30 per weighted procedure, bringing a single PT session to a cost of around $100. Clinics usually charge more than the amount allowed by the insurance and write off the difference. As a cash patient, you can negotiate rates with the therapist. Ask for a discount equal to average insurance write offs, and let the company know that you’ll pay cash up front so they can save money in the billing process. A service that is charged at $100 may only cost you $50 when you pay in cash., 1 For example, Baudendistel Physical Therapy charges $100 for an initial evaluation and $75 for each one-hour physical therapy session. 2 Kathe Wallace Physical Therapy in Washington charges $165-$205 for a one-hour initial evaluation, $112 for appointments less than 45 minutes and $150 for a session of 50 to 55 minutes. 1 Physical therapy typically is covered by health insurance when medically necessary. 2 For patients not covered by health insurance, physical therapy typically costs $50-$350 or more per session, depending on the length of the session, the service provided during the session and the provider., 1 Many providers offer discounted packages. 2 For example, Joint Ventures Physical Therapy and Fitness in Massachusetts charges $70 for a half-hour session and $105 for an hour-long session, but offers packages that take $10 off the cost of each session. 1 Physical therapy typically is covered by health insurance when medically necessary. 2 For patients not covered by health insurance, physical therapy typically costs $50-$350 or more per session, depending on the length of the session, the service provided during the session and the provider., 3. Finally, a weighted average of the excess cost per initial visit was calculated by using the share of LUPA initial visits provided by each discipline (skilled nursing (77.8%), physical therapy (21.7%), and speech pathology (0.5%), yielding a LUPA add-on payment amount of $87.93. For instance, if Provider A delivers 100 visits at an average cost of $100 per visit and Provider B delivers 1,000 visits at an average cost of $50 per visit then the simple provider mean of $75 [($100 + $50)/2 = $75] does not account for the fact that Provider B visits are more common in the population., What they found was that across the board, physical therapy was the less costly approach. Initial referral for physical therapy cost $504 on average (for an average 3.8 visits), compared with an average of $1,306 for magnetic resonance imaging (the technology used in almost all of the imaging, according to authors). Even more dramatically, average subsequent costs over the next year were over 66% lower for the patients who began with a physical therapy referral--$1,871, compared with $6,664 charged to the imaging group over the same time period.

The biggest advantage of using fossil fuels is that they can be easily stored and transported from one place to another large reserves of coal are therefore taken from the coal mines to the industries which are acres away from the mines the petroleum is also taken to too far off power stations to produce energy fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy this is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative source. Tenefits of fossil fuels fossil fuels are basically the remains of animals and plants and these are good energy resources the three main fossil fuels are natural gas oil and coal fossil fuels are low in cost and are very important resources for our economy fossil fuels are used to generate electricity used as fuels for transportation. Fossil fuels are energy resources that come from the remains of plants and animals these remains are millions of years old there are three fossil fuels petroleum oil natural gas and coal fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road they heat our homes and light up the night theyre the bedrock we base our energy mix on. Advantages of fossil fuels a major advantage of fossil fuels is their capacity to generate huge amounts of electricity in just a single location fossil fuels are very easy to find when coal is used in power plants they are very cost effective coal is also in abundant supply transporting oil and gas to the power stations can be made through the use of pipes making it an easy task disadvantages of fossil fuels pollution is a major disadvantage of fossil fuels this is because they give off carbon dioxide when burned thereby causing a greenhouse effect this is also the main contributory factor to the global warming experienced by the earth today. Benefits one of the biggest benefits of fossil fuels is their cost coal oil and natural gas are abundant right now and relatively inexpensive to drill or mine for in fact coal is the most plentiful fossil fuel and it is found over much of the world fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road they heat our homes and light up the night theyre the bedrock we base our energy mix on.

Over the years, the Eiffel Tower has been the site of numerous high-profile stunts, ceremonial events and even scientific experiments., Located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most well known structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower was originally built as the entrance arch for the World's Fair in 1889. It is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company was in charge of the project. The Eiffel Tower is 320 metres (1050 feet) in height and was the tallest man made structure in the world for 41 years before being surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York. The Eiffel Tower is made of iron and weighs around 10000 tonnes., Visit the Eiffel tower and learn more about its history and amazing technology. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was built by Gustave Eiffel in just 26 months. It took 18,038 parts, 3,000 workshop drawings, 700 engineering plans and 2,500,000 rivets to raise this structure weighing 7,300 tons and measuring 1,050 feet high. 1 The Cineiffel is a room with unusual images of the Eiffel Tower. 2 The Totem, a series of 8 television screens invites you to a higher space to discover the magic box of virtual images depicting Gustave Eiffel and his Tower. 3 An electronic telescope to discover Paris in all its detail., Despite its height, the Eiffel Tower was designed to be wind resistant, swaying only a few inches in the wind. It actually moves further when the iron on the sun facing side heats and expands, moving the top up to 7 inches (18 centimetres) away from the sun. The Eiffel Tower is 320 metres (1050 feet) in height and was the tallest man made structure in the world for 41 years before being surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York. The Eiffel Tower is made of iron and weighs around 10000 tonnes., Because of the addition of the aerial atop the Eiffel Tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast aerials, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct. The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second. The third level observatory's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground, the highest accessible to the public in the European Union., Come and visit us! The tower was built as the theme structure of the Universal Exposition of 1889, which was held in Paris. The city originally signed a contract for an operating concession for 20 years, and after that (in 1909) the concession would revert back to the City of Paris. The Eiffel Tower construction started in 1887, and ended in 1888.

The Darwin-Darwinism relation is in certain respects a causal relation, in the sense that Darwin influenced the debates that followed him. But there is also something more: a kind of isomorphism between Darwin's Darwinism and historical Darwinism., The reaction of some conservat … ive religious people to his Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection was a negative contribution that, for some people, has held back the understanding of science by a hundred years., Famous Scientists. Charles Darwin, widely considered as one of the greatest and most revolutionizing scientists in history, was the British naturalist who formulated the theory of evolution., Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin, widely considered as one of the greatest and most revolutionizing scientists in history, was the British naturalist who formulated the theory of evolution. Pre-Darwin, it was thought that each species of life on earth came individually and that none had ever changed its form., Charles Darwin's contribution was combining competition for resources, avoidance of predators, and the ability to attract a mate for the purpose of reproduction into a single theory called Natural Selection., His work included putting together Darwin's Theory of Evolution through Natural Selection with Gregor Mendel's work in Genetics and the field of phylogenetics. This became known as the Modern Synthesis of Evolutionary Theory., The incorporation of genetics and Darwin's theory is known as modern evolutionary synthesis.. The physical and behavioral changes that make natural selection possible happen at the level of DNA and genes. Such changes are called mutations.

The pelvic organs include the uterus (womb), fallopian (fuh-LOH-pee-uhn) tubes (tubes), ovaries, and cervix. 1 Pelvic inflammatory disease is treated with antibiotics. 2 Complications of untreated pelvic inflammatory disease can include scarring of the pelvic organs and infertility., 1 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's pelvic organs including the uterus (womb), Fallopian tubes (tubes), ovaries, and cervix. 2 Pelvic inflammatory disease develops as the result of spread of a sexually transmitted disease. 1 Pelvic inflammatory disease is treated with antibiotics. 2 Complications of untreated pelvic inflammatory disease can include scarring of the pelvic organs and infertility., As a PID controller relies only on the measured process variable, not on knowledge of the underlying process, it is a broadly useful controller. By tuning the three parameters of the model, one can design a PID controller for specific process requirements. If the PID controller parameters (the gains of the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output diverges, with or without oscillation, and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage., Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of a woman’s reproductive organs. It is a complication often caused by some STDs, like chlamydia and gonorrhea. Other infections that are not sexually transmitted can also cause PID. Untreated sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious condition, in women. Basic Fact Sheet | Detailed Version. Basic fact sheets are presented in plain language for individuals with general questions about sexually transmitted diseases., You may have heard of pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID, but many people are not sure what it is. PID is a serious infection that harms a woman's reproductive organs. It develops when an infection spreads up from the vagina and cervix into the fallopian tubes, uterus, and ovaries. The more times a woman has PID, the greater are her chances of becoming infertile. Pelvic inflammatory disease is often difficult to identify because the symptoms seem like those of other conditions, such as appendicitis, urinary tract infections, ovarian cysts, and endometriosis., A proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism (controller) commonly used in industrial control systems. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. If the PID controller parameters (the gains of the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output diverges, with or without oscillation, and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage., Complications. PID may result in adhesions or scarring of the fallopian tubes and pelvis, and is a common cause of pelvic pain and ectopic pregnancy. About a third of all women who are infertile have lost the ability to conceive because of PID. Occasionally, PID causes intraperitoneal abscesses. Infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and adjacent pelvic structures that is not associated with surgery or pregnancy. PID usually is caused by an ascending infection in which disease-producing germs spread from the vagina and cervix to the upper portions of the female reproductive tract. chlamydia; gonorrhea;, Short for process identifier, a PID is a unique number that identifies each of the running processes in an operating system such as Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows. In the below output, is an example of a few of the processes running in Windows and their associated PID's listed in the PID column. PID. 1. Short for product identification or product id, PID is a unique number that helps identify a hardware product or a registered software product. For example, in the case of a computer mouse, its PID is often found on the bottom of the mouse or in the case of a wireless mouse inside the battery compartment., Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's pelvic organs. The pelvic organs include the uterus (womb), fallopian tubes (fuh-LOH-pee-uhn toobs), ovaries, and cervix. Without treatment, PID can lead to severe problems like infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Any damage done to your pelvic organs before you start treatment likely cannot be undone. Still, don't put off getting treatment. If you do, you may not be able to have children.

Some people ask why should marijuana be legalized but we should ask why should marijuana be illegal from a philosophical point of view individuals deserve the right to make choices for themselves the government only has a right to limit those choices if the individuals actions endanger someone else summary we would have more money to spend on important problems if marijuana were legal the third major reason that marijuana should be legal is because prohibition does not help the country in any way and causes a lot of problemsSince vitamin A is fat-soluble it is not needed in daily, large quantities. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body in organs such as the liver. Most of the vitamin A that we consume goes to the liver to be stored until it is needed by another part of the body. The vitamin A that we obtain from animal products is called retinoids and can be used by our bodies without any modification. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables is known as carotenoids. The most common type of carotenoid is-carotene (beta carotene)., In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods 1 : Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2 Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester, Overview. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning that your body doesn't store it. You have to get what you need from food, including citrus fruits, broccoli, and tomatoes. You need vitamin C for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body, 1 Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2 Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. 3 It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods 1 : Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2 Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester, Vitamin A is also used for shigellosis, diseases of the nervous system, nose infections, loss of sense of smell, asthma, persistent headaches, kidney stones, overactive thyroid, iron-poor blood (anemia), deafness, ringing in the ears, and precancerous mouth sores (leukoplakia). It can also be made in a laboratory. Vitamin A is used for treating vitamin A deficiency. It is also used to reduce complications of diseases such as malaria, HIV, measles, and diarrhea in children with, Vitamin A is a group of unsaturated nutritional organic compounds, that includes retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and several provitamin A carotenoids, and beta-carotene. Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods 1 : Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2 Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester, Beta-carotene is a precursor for vitamin A. The body needs to convert it to retinol or vitamin A for use. Beta-carotene is found naturally in mostly orange and dark green plant foods, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos, and kale. Vitamin A is a family of fat-soluble compounds that play an important role in vision, bone growth, reproduction, cell division, and cell differentiation. Vitamin A is important for healthy bones. However, too much vitamin A has been linked to bone loss and an increase in the risk of hip fracture., Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system, and reproduction. Vitamin A also helps the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs work properly. There are two different types of vitamin A. The first type, preformed vitamin A, is found in meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. The second type, provitamin A, is found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based products. The most common type of provitamin A in foods and dietary supplements is beta-carotene, Two forms of vitamin A are available in the human diet: preformed vitamin A (retinol and its esterified form, retinyl ester) and provitamin A carotenoids [ 1-5 ]. Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat (especially liver). By far the most important provitamin A carotenoid is beta-carotene; other provitamin A carotenoids are alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. A portion of the vitamin A in some supplements is in the form of beta-carotene and the remainder is preformed vitamin A; others contain only preformed vitamin A or only beta-carotene. Supplement labels usually indicate the percentage of each form of the vitamin.thus while marijuanabased medications should be available on a prescription basis from a pharmacy pot use should not be normalized and the marijuana drug should be illegal bob enyart is pastor of the denver bible church in arvada colorado please add a username to view or add comments regarding marijuana use or any moral question arguing right and wrong in todays society is especially difficult because a growing number of people reject absolute right and wrong. Marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal drug in the us and around the world those who support its legalization for medical or for general use fail to recognize that the greatest costs of marijuana are not related to its prohibition they are the costs resulting from marijuana use itself many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldomif everdescribe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug. The costs of legalizing marijuana would not only be financial new marijuana users would not be limited to adults if marijuana were legalized just as regulations on alcohol and tobacco do not prevent use by youth many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldomif everdescribe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug. Recreational use of marijuana will only lead to a greater degree of drug addiction in the united states once we legalize recreational use of marijuana it is a slippery slope towards the legalization of other illegal drugs that are more hard core because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post. Why we should not legalize marijuana shares contrary to the beliefs of those who advocate the legalization of marijuana the current balanced restrictive and bipartisan drug policies of the united states are working reasonably well and they have contributed to reductions in the rate of marijuana use in our nation many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldomif everdescribe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug. If the us were to legalize marijuana the number of marijuana users would increase today there are 152 million current marijuana users in comparison to 129 million alcohol users and 709 million tobacco users many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldomif everdescribe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug
Marijuana should not be made legal for recreational use because it will have drastic negative effects on the us economy persons who are under the influence of narcotics like marijuana are not able to function in a manner that allows them to perform daily tasks needed for a job because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post .In my personal opinion marijuana should be legalized for recreational use not only is it statistically the safest of any drug used in america or around the world it also has zero reported deaths from use because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post

Email Article. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a disease transmitted by ticks and is most prevalent in the east coast, midwest, and plains regions. Rocky Mountain spotted fever affects dogs and humans. Through blood tests, it has been demonstrated that cats may also become infected, but the disease in cats is minimal, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is considered the most severe tick-borne disease in the US, with a high mortality rate among untreated cases. RMSF has a disease presence in Florida, with the number of cases increasing in the summer months. The American dog tick is the main transmitter in Florida. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently identified the brown dog tick as a vector for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) in the southwestern United States and along the Mexican border., Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), also known as blue disease, is the most lethal and most frequently reported rickettsial illness in the United States.

the cost of spaying your rabbit is going to greatly vary on a few different factors 1 in your less populated area where the cost of living is relatively low the prices can range anywhere from 85 to 200 2 on average most of your typical clinics are going to charge anywhere from 150 to 300 1 medications for a rabbit will start around 20  80 a shot such as a metacam shot may be required before the procedure begins 2 a shot such as this can cost upwards of 10 to 30 depending on the vet 3 the vet will more than likely want a follow up visit
what does the surgery cost spayneuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country the low end of the range can be as inexpensive as 5075 often in spayneuter clinics while vets in major metropolitan areas where rents and labor costs are very high often charge several hundred dollars see our veterinary listings
It is not cheap though expect around 100 for a neuter and 200 for a spay they need to use a different anesthesia for rabbits than with dogs and cats make sure you use a rabbit knowledgeable vet rabbits can make good pets for some people as long as you have realistic expectations rabbits can get pregnant at 13 weeks of age so keep them separate until spayed neutered female rabbits have a reproductive cancer rate near 85 so an unspayed female almost always lives a very short life
The eating disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, respectively, affect 0.5 percent and 2-3 percent of women over their lifetime. The most common age of onset is between 12-25. Although much more common in females, 10 percent of cases detected are in males. , Bulimia Nervosa Overview. Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is characterized by repeatedly eating abnormally large amounts of food in a short period of time and then trying to compensate for the binge by purging (i.e., engaging in self-induced vomiting, using laxatives or diuretics), exercising excessively, or fasting. The average age of onset for bulimia is 18 years, but it occurs in children as young as 9 and adults into their mid-40s and older. Most bulimics go through a period of prolonged dieting or restricted eating before the cyclic binging-purging episodes begin., Bulimia nervosa, also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to attempts to rid oneself of the food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking a laxative. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%., Bulimia nervosa (buh-LEE-me-ah nur-VOH-suh), often called bulimia, is a type of eating disorder. A person with bulimia eats a lot of food in a short amount of time (binging) and then tries to prevent weight gain by getting rid of the food (purging). A person with bulimia may be thin, overweight, or have a normal weight. Also, bulimic behavior, such as throwing up, is often done in private because the person with bulimia feels shame or disgust. This makes it hard to know if someone has bulimia. But there are warning signs to look out for., EPIDEMIOLOGY. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia nervosa for women in the United States is 0.5% to 1%, the prevalence of bulimia nervosa is 2% to 3% and can be as high as 10% in vulnerable populations, such as college-aged women. Males are affected by eating disorders at a rate one tenth of that of females. Bulimia nervosa is a common and treatable condition that often presents in the primary care setting. The hallmark sign for bulimia nervosa is a distorted view of food and eating. Patients with this condition often maintain a normal or above-normal weight., A person with bulimia feels he or she cannot control the amount of food eaten. Also, bulimics might exercise a lot, eat very little or not at all, or take pills to pass urine often to prevent weight gain. Unlike anorexia, people with bulimia can fall within the normal range for their age and weight. But like people with anorexia, bulimics: 1 Fear gaining weight. A person with bulimia may be thin, overweight, or have a normal weight. Also, bulimic behavior, such as throwing up, is often done in private because the person with bulimia feels shame or disgust. This makes it hard to know if someone has bulimia. But there are warning signs to look out for., Lifetime Prevalence. The reported lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa among women has ranged from 0.9% - 2.2% and 0.2 - 0.3% in men (Keski-R et al 2008). With regard to bulimia nervosa, estimates of lifetime prevalence among women range from 1.5% to 2% and 0.5% in men. Prevalence of eating disorders in young children is unknown. Eating disorders have been reported in up to 4% of adolescents and young adults. The most common age at onset for anorexia nervosa is the mid teens; in 5% of the patients, the onset of the disorder is in the early twenties. The onset of bulimia nervosa is usually in adolescence but may be as late as early adulthood., By Psych Central Staff ~ 2 min read. People with bulimia nervosa consume large amounts of food and then rid their bodies of the excess calories by vomiting, abusing laxatives or diuretics, taking enemas, or exercising obsessively. Some use a combination of all these forms of purging. , At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50% of people are fully recovered. Globally, bulimia was estimated to affect 6.5 million people in 2013. About 1% of young women have bulimia at a given point in time and about 2% to 3% of women have the condition at some point in their lives. The condition is less common in the developing world. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%.

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements in recent years. AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. One area where AI has made significant progress is in natural language processing (NLP). NLP deals with the interaction between computers and human language, enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This has led to the development of virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, as well as language translation tools and chatbots. Another application of AI is in computer vision, which involves teaching computers to understand and interpret visual data. This has paved the way for advancements in image and object recognition, facial recognition, and even autonomous vehicles that can see and navigate their surroundings. AI has also found its way into various industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. In healthcare, AI is being used to analyze medical data, assist in diagnoses, and develop personalized treatment plans. In finance, AI algorithms are utilized for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment. In manufacturing, AI-powered robots and automation systems are improving efficiency and productivity. While AI holds immense potential, there are ethical considerations that need to be addressed. The impact of AI on jobs and the workforce is a significant concern, as automation may lead to job displacement in certain sectors. There are also concerns about bias in AI algorithms and the need for transparency and accountability in AI decision-making. In conclusion, artificial intelligence has revolutionized various aspects of our lives, from communication to healthcare and beyond. Its advancements in natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning have opened up new possibilities and transformed industries. However, it is crucial to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly, taking into account ethical considerations and addressing potential risks.

In conclusion, the Internet has had a profound impact on society, transforming the way we communicate, work, and access information. It has opened up endless possibilities and opportunities, but also comes with its share of challenges. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, it is important to leverage the power of the Internet responsibly and stay informed about online safety and security.
Gold is not formed on the Earth like diamonds and many other gems and minerals. Instead, most scientists now believe that gold actually came to earth from outer space in large meteorites that have struck the planet over billions of years. While diamonds can be artificially produced, there is only so much gold available on the planet. It cannot be created in a lab the way that many gemstones can be. While some scientists believe that gold mining in outer space may be the bonanza of the future, such dreams are currently too expensive to be realized., Gold is an element and is formed in the core of large stars, especially during a nova. On Earth, veins of gold are formed by separation from liquid rock after gravity agglomer … ates the molecules. It will form long chains within spaces in minerals because of its resistance to combining with lighter elements. Gold isn't a rock. It is a chemical element, or, in the eyes of the geologist or miner, it is a mineral. It is … sometimes referred to as a noble metal because it doesn't react easily with other stuff in the earth. That translates into gold appearing as a pure metal in the form or tiny flakes, nuggets or the like., On Earth, gold is found in ores in rock formed from the Precambrian time onward. It most often occurs as a native metal, typically in a metal solid solution with silver (i.e. as a gold silver alloy). Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8–10%. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear., The process of erosion had sloughed fragments of gold from the reef into the gully. - Robyn Annear. Ancient Greeks believed that gold was formed by the rays of the sun transforming common metals in the earth. Scientists today still think that gold formation is related to stars, specifically dying stars. At the core of a dying star-a supernova-elements begin to fuse together in the extreme heat. , Gold is not formed in rock so much as it will tend to concentrate under certain geologic conditions. We see evidence of gold grains in some rivers, and nuggets in some rock formations. Gold isn't a rock. It is a chemical element, or, in the eyes of the geologist or miner, it is a mineral. It is … sometimes referred to as a noble metal because it doesn't react easily with other stuff in the earth. That translates into gold appearing as a pure metal in the form or tiny flakes, nuggets or the like., Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear., Answer 1: Gold, in its pure form is not made-it occurs naturally in an elemental form. On a side note, the history of alchemy was largely based on the desire of people (probably kings!) to combine other (cheap and abundant) elements and compounds to make gold. Most of the gold products such as jewelry, etc., have a rating in karats, as you probably already know., Gold is an element and is formed in the core of large stars, especially during a nova. On Earth, veins of gold are formed by separation from liquid rock after gravity agglomer … ates the molecules. It will form long chains within spaces in minerals because of its resistance to combining with lighter elements. Remember that gold is an element, and it isn't made or formed in nature so much as it is a part of the mix of the things that make up the earth's structure. A link can be found below to the Wikipedia post on gold., Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Gold was formed in the sense of being placed on the earth when the earth was formed by cooling down from gas ejected by the Sun some 4.5 billion years ago. Gold deposits were laid down as rocks formed as part of that cooling process. The amount of gold in the earth has been constant since then. None has been made on earth, either naturally or by alchemists (who dreamed of turning lead into gold).
