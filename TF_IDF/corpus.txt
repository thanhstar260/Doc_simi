we have been feeding our back yard squirrels for the fall and winter and we noticed that a few of them have missing fur one has a patch missing down his back and under both arms also another has some missing on his whole chest they are all eating and seem to have a good appetite critters cannot stand the smell of human hair so sprinkling a barrier of hair clippings around your garden or lightly working it into the soil when you plant bulbs apparently does have some merit the whole thing kind of makes me laugh it never occurred to me that we are the ones that stink spread some human hair around your vegetable and flower gardens this will scare the squirrels away because humans are predators of squirrels it is better if the hair hasnt been washed so the squirrels will easily pick up the human scent 1 you can sprinkle blood meal around your garden as well 2 don’t trap and relocate squirrels 3 this is a losing battle since the population of squirrels is extremely high 4 also if the animal is a female there is a high likelihood that you will remove her from babies that depend on her for survival hair loss in squirrels can be caused by mange or fungal disease mange is a disease caused by microscopic mites that burrow under the skin the squirrel mange mite has been reported in both fox and gray squirrels there have been no reports of this type of mange being transmitted to humans or domestic pets 1 you can also scatter dog or human hair around your garden 2 one readers shares i used to have a problem with squirrels digging up my bulbs 3 now once in the spring and once in the fall i ask my hairdresser to save a big bag of hair for me 4 i lightly dig this into the soil rabbit repellent human hair will keep rabbits out of your garden collect hair from your brushes and spread it around your garden via pioneer thinking natural mulch when woven into a mat it retains moisture it deters weeds in some instances it can actually reduce soil erosion via npr plant fertilizer
the biggest advantage of using fossil fuels is that they can be easily stored and transported from one place to another large reserves of coal are therefore taken from the coal mines to the industries which are acres away from the mines the petroleum is also taken to too far off power stations to produce energy fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy this is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative source benefits of fossil fuels fossil fuels are basically the remains of animals and plants and these are good energy resources the three main fossil fuels are natural gas oil and coal fossil fuels are low in cost and are very important resources for our economy fossil fuels are used to generate electricity used as fuels for transportation fossil fuels are energy resources that come from the remains of plants and animals these remains are millions of years old there are three fossil fuels petroleum oil natural gas and coal fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road they heat our homes and light up the night theyre the bedrock we base our energy mix on advantages of fossil fuels a major advantage of fossil fuels is their capacity to generate huge amounts of electricity in just a single location fossil fuels are very easy to find when coal is used in power plants they are very cost effective coal is also in abundant supply transporting oil and gas to the power stations can be made through the use of pipes making it an easy task disadvantages of fossil fuels pollution is a major disadvantage of fossil fuels this is because they give off carbon dioxide when burned thereby causing a greenhouse effect this is also the main contributory factor to the global warming experienced by the earth today benefits one of the biggest benefits of fossil fuels is their cost coal oil and natural gas are abundant right now and relatively inexpensive to drill or mine for in fact coal is the most plentiful fossil fuel and it is found over much of the world fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road they heat our homes and light up the night theyre the bedrock we base our energy mix on fossil fuels also generate a lot of money and are a good source of revenue to many countries they also help related industries provide jobs for people across the globe which is good for the overall economy fossil fuels are used for both residential and commercial purposes the three main fossil fuels are natural gas oil and coal fossil fuels are low in cost and are very important resources for our economy fossil fuels are used to generate electricity used as fuels for transportation 1 easily available since these fossil fuels have been of such a great source of energy more and more extractions are going on every day the geologists all around the world are trying to find out mines of coals the pressure is even more as the population is increasing day by day fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy this is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative source you have undoubtedly heard of fuels such as coal oil and natural gas these are the three main types of fossil fuels you rely on fossil fuels every day for such tasks as fueling your car and heating your home and its very likely that the electricity in your home comes from a power plant that uses fossil fuels lets review fossil fuels are sources of energy that formed from the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago pressure heat and time allow the organic matter to transform into one of the three major types of fossil fuels which are coal oil and natural gas fossil fuels are sources of energy that have developed within the earth over millions of years because fossil fuelsoil natural gas and coaltake so long to form they are considered nonrenewable lets review fossil fuels are sources of energy that formed from the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago pressure heat and time allow the organic matter to transform into one of the three major types of fossil fuels which are coal oil and natural gas
apothem the apothem of a regular polygon is a segment drawn the center of the polygon that is the center of the circle which circumscribes the polygon to one side such that it is perpendicular to the side if a regular polygon has an area of a square units a perimeter of p units an apothem of a units then the area is onehalf the product of the perimeter and the apothem be careful with this formula though for a given apothem there is only one possible value of p apothems the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides the apothem of a square is equal to half of the length of one side apothem of a regular polygon definition a line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side try this adjust the polygon below by dragging any orange dot or alter the number of sides note the behavior of the apothem line shown in blue the word apothem can refer to the line itself or the length of that line so you can correctly say draw the apothem and the apothem is 4cm each formula below shows how to find the length of the apothem of a regular polygon use the formula that uses the facts you are given to start more the distance from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side for a circle it is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a chord regular polygonsproperties the apothem is also the radius of the incircle of the polygon for a polygon of n sides there are n possible apothems all the same length of course the word apothem can refer to the line itself or the length of that line so you can correctly say draw the apothem and the apothem is 4cm each formula below shows how to find the length of the apothem of a regular polygon use the formula that uses the facts you are given to start apothem of a hexagon the apothem of a regular polygon is a line segment from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides equivalently it is the line drawn from the center of the polygon that is perpendicular to one of its sides the word apothem can also refer to the length of that line segment because of this all the apothems in a polygon will be congruent for a regular pyramid which is a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon the apothem is the slant height of a lateral face that is the shortest distance from apex to base on a given face for an equilateral triangle the apothem is equivalent to the line segment from the midpoint of a side to any of the triangles centers since an equilateral triangles centers coincide as a consequence of the definition because of this all the apothems in a polygon will be congruent for a regular pyramid which is a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon the apothem is the slant height of a lateral face that is the shortest distance from apex to base on a given face given a circle the apothem is the perpendicular distance from the midpoint of a chord to the circle s center it is also equal to the radius minus the sagitta for a regular polygon the apothem simply is the distance from the center to a side ie the inradius of the polygon see also chord circular sector circular segment inradius radius regular polygon sagitta cite this as weisstein eric w apothem from mathworld a wolfram web resource apothem is a line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side its also defined as radius of the incircle of the polygon for a regular polygon of n sides there are n possible apothems of same length if we assume a right angled triangle where the apothem is the adjacent side half the side of the polygon to be the opposite side and line joining the centre of the polygon and vertex of the polygon to be the hypotenuse lets assume the angle formed by adjacent side and hypotenuse to be \theta

some people ask why should marijuana be legalized but we should ask why should marijuana be illegal from a philosophical point of view individuals deserve the right to make choices for themselves the government only has a right to limit those choices if the individuals actions endanger someone else summary we would have more money to spend on important problems if marijuana were legal the third major reason that marijuana should be legal is because prohibition does not help the country in any way and causes a lot of problems thus while marijuanabased medications should be available on a prescription basis from a pharmacy pot use should not be normalized and the marijuana drug should be illegal bob enyart is pastor of the denver bible church in arvada colorado please add a username to view or add comments regarding marijuana use or any moral question arguing right and wrong in todays society is especially difficult because a growing number of people reject absolute right and wrong marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal drug in the us and around the world those who support its legalization for medical or for general use fail to recognize that the greatest costs of marijuana are not related to its prohibition they are the costs resulting from marijuana use itself many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug the costs of legalizing marijuana would not only be financial new marijuana users would not be limited to adults if marijuana were legalized just as regulations on alcohol and tobacco do not prevent use by youth many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug recreational use of marijuana will only lead to a greater degree of drug addiction in the united states once we legalize recreational use of marijuana it is a slippery slope towards the legalization of other illegal drugs that are more hard core because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post why we should not legalize marijuana shares contrary to the beliefs of those who advocate the legalization of marijuana the current balanced restrictive and bipartisan drug policies of the united states are working reasonably well and they have contributed to reductions in the rate of marijuana use in our nation many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug if the us were to legalize marijuana the number of marijuana users would increase today there are 152 million current marijuana users in comparison to 129 million alcohol users and 709 million tobacco users many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug marijuana should not be made legal for recreational use because it will have drastic negative effects on the us economy persons who are under the influence of narcotics like marijuana are not able to function in a manner that allows them to perform daily tasks needed for a job because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post in my personal opinion marijuana should be legalized for recreational use not only is it statistically the safest of any drug used in america or around the world it also has zero reported deaths from use because people wants it as recreational use and it stops the risk of arrest for use because marijuana users are less likely to be harmful to someone and it also has health benefits such as it cures cancer and other illnessesdiseases such as diabetes and other harmful illnesses alcohol was once illegal report post

a selfinsured retention sir” differs from a deductible in that a sir is an amount that an insured retains and covers before insurance coverage begins to apply once a sir is satisfied the insurer is then liable for amounts exceeding the retention less any agreed deductible in contrast a deductible is an amount that an insurer subtracts from a policy amount reducing the amount of insurance with a deductible the insurer has the liability and defense risk from the beginning and then deducts the deductible amount from the insured coverage27 in an insurance policy the deductible is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses in general usage the term deductible may be used to describe one of several types of clauses see below that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments selfinsured retentions vs deductibles your skin in the game selfinsured retentions sir and deductibles are the two conventional mechanisms insureds use to reduce both premiums and loss ratios in liability policies using either simply to reduce premiums is foolish and could prove to be very dangerous a selfinsured retention means that the insured carries a fixed amount of risk including adjusting and legal expenses the insurance policy whether a primary or umbrella contract is excess coverage above the sir if you are selfemployed you may be eligible to deduct premiums that you pay for medical dental and qualifying longterm care insurance coverage for yourself your spouse and your dependents the bottom line if you qualify the deduction for selfemployed health insurance premiums is a valuable tax break with the rising cost of health insurance a tax deduction can help you pay at least a portion of the premium cost and that will help to keep you healthy—and happy—in 2013 and beyond however there are important differences in the way they operate insurance policies written with deductibles provide that the insurer will pay the defense and indemnity costs in connection with a covered claim and then charge or bill back the deductible amount to the insured another difference between a deductible and a sir is that the sir does not reduce available policy limits whereas a deductible may reduce policy limits thus an excess insurance contract with limits of 750000 sitting above a 250000 sir will provide the insured with 750000 in coverage once the sir is satisfied 1 a health insurance deductible is different from other types of deductibles 2 unlike auto renters or homeowners insurance where you don’t get services until you pay your deductible many health insurance plans provide some benefits before you meet the deductible a deductible requires the insured to pay the first level of expenses or damages before the insurer is on the hook” in a business liability or workers compensation policies deductibles range from nothing to 250000 or more

cost variance is in short the difference between the budgeted cost and the actual cost on your project at any one point i want to know what the formula to calculate the cost variance is itll be great if someone can give me the general formula as well as an example applying the formula for calculating the cost variance of a project cost variance is the budgeted cost of work performed minus the actual cost of work performed in other words it is the difference between planned and actual costs of certain tasks within a specified period cost and schedule variance data are part of earned value analysis which is a tool that small and large businesses use as an earlywarning system to identify and manage problems in ongoing projects a cost variance is the difference between the cost actually incurred and the budgeted or planned amount of cost that should have been incurred cost variances are most commonly tracked for expense line items but can also be tracked at the job or project level as long as there is a budget or standard against which it can be calculated these variances form a standard part of many management reporting systems there is an unfavorable cost variance when the actual cost incurred is greater than the budgeted amount there is a favorable cost variance when the actual cost incurred is lower than the budgeted amount whether a variance ends up being positive or negative is partially due to the care with which the original budget was assembled cost variances are most commonly tracked for expense line items but can also be tracked at the job or project level as long as there is a budget or standard against which it can be calculated these variances form a standard part of many management reporting systems 0 votes cost variance is simply the difference between what i budgeted and what i actually spent so if i budgeted 5000 for paint and the actual invoices for paint for the project added up to 4500 i have a 500 positive cost variance i want to know what the formula to calculate the cost variance is itll be great if someone can give me the general formula as well as an example applying the formula for calculating the cost variance of a project the most simple form of cost variance analysis is to subtract the budgeted or standard cost from the actual incurred cost and reporting on the reasons for the difference a more refined approach is to split this difference into two elements 1 price variance 2 that portion of the variance caused by a difference between the actual and expected price of the goods or services acquired 3 volume variance 4 that portion of the variance caused by any change in the volume of goods or services ordered for example a company has an unfavorable variance in its cost of goods sold of 40000 a detailed cost variance analysis reveals that the company sold several hundred more units than it expected and the cost of those additional units comprised 35000 of the variance a more refined approach is to split this difference into two elements 1 price variance 2 that portion of the variance caused by a difference between the actual and expected price of the goods or services acquired 3 volume variance 4 that portion of the variance caused by any change in the volume of goods or services ordered cost variance cv is the amount of money that was actually spent on a project or a part of a project compared to the amount of work that was actually accomplished cost variance is the budgeted cost of work performed minus the actual cost of work performed tell me more … in the earned value reporting system for projects we are concerned with knowing how our project is doing with respect to the amount of money being spent and the accomplishments being achieved the cost variance is an important figure to the project manager and the other managers of the company because it is an indicator of how well the project is doing in terms of spending its budget definition cost variance is a way of showing the financial performance of a project specifically it is the mathematical difference between budgeted cost of work performed or bcwp and the actual cost of work performed or acwp therefore companies pay close attention to their budgets and the cost of everything that happens within the business one number of particular significance for general operational and project planning is the cost variance total

electromagnetic waves are formed by the vibrations of electric and magnetic fields these fields are perpendicular to one another in the direction the wave is traveling once formed this energy travels at the speed of light until further interaction with matter these changing fields form electromagnetic waves electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate this means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials but also through the vacuum of space electromagnetic waves are made up of particles called photons electromagnetic waves carries by the small particles named photon electromagnetic waves are made of photon charges ehfhcr zq2cr where q is the photon charge 43 e18 coulombs 8 13 electrons13u1d quark an electric field and a magnetic field that are orthogonal to each other and oscillating at the same frequency as the electric and magnetic fields move back and forth they create the same waves being emitted from them they waves are called electromagnetic wavesradiation there are 7 classifications of these waves radiowaves microwaves infrared visible light ultraviolet light xrays and gamma rays electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy the light that we see is a type of electromagnetic radiation however it is only a very small part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum sound another form of energy is not part of this spectrum electromagnetic radiation is different from sound in that it can travel in space and does not need a medium like air or water to travel through electromagnetic radiation is made when an atom absorbs energy the absorbed energy causes one or more electrons to change their locale within the atom when the electron returns to its original position an electromagnetic wave is produced light is not the only example of an electromagnetic wave other electromagnetic waves include the microwaves you use to heat up leftovers for dinner and the radio waves that are broadcast from radio stations properties of electromagnetic waves something interesting about light and electromagnetic waves in general is that no medium is required for the wave to travel through other waves such as sound waves can not travel through a vacuum an electromagnetic wave is perfectly happy to do that electromagnetic radiation em radiation or emr is the radiant energy released by certain electromagnetic processes visible light is one type of electromagnetic radiation other familiar forms are invisible electromagnetic radiations such as radio waves infrared light and x rays electromagnetic waves are produced whenever charged particles are accelerated and these waves can subsequently interact with any charged particles em waves carry energy momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact classically electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum electromagnetic waves are produced whenever charged particles are accelerated and these waves can subsequently interact with any charged particles em waves carry energy momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact the electromagnetic waves that compose electromagnetic radiation can be imagined as a selfpropagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields electromagnetic waves are produced whenever charged particles are accelerated and these waves can subsequently interact with any charged particles em waves carry energy momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact light microwaves xrays and tv and radio transmissions are all kinds of electromagnetic waves different waves are made by their wavelengths electric fields are created by differences in voltage the higher the voltage the stronger will be the resultant field electromagnetic fields are found everywhere in nature but are invisible to the human eye there are also many humanmade electromagnetic fields an example of a humanmade electromagnetic wave are xrays there are many other types of waves that you can see on this website no electromagnetic waves are part of a spectrum of energy waves that include radio waves infra red visible light through to ultraviolet and microwaves and gamma radiation … ultrasound waves are high frequency beyond human hearing range that are generated by vibration of crystals as the electric and magnetic fields move back and forth they create the same waves being emitted from them they waves are called electromagnetic wavesradiation there are 7 classifications of these waves radiowaves microwaves infrared visible light ultraviolet light xrays and gamma rays the magnetic and electric fields of an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of the wave james clerk maxwell and heinrich hertz are two scientists who studied how electromagnetic

steam in a large pot bring several inches of water to a boil put artichoke in a steamer basket and suspend over the boiling water cover and reduce heat to a simmer steam for about 25 minutes the artichoke is done when a knife inserted into the base meets no resistance much like a baked potato 4 cook 25 to 35 minutes steam the artichokes until you can pierce the artichoke hearts with the tip of a paring knife and easily pull the inner leaves out with your fingers or a pair of tongs place the artichokes in a steamer basket over the boiling water and cover the pot steam the artichokes until tender – up to an hour with a conventional pot or 20 to 30 minutes with a pressure cooker exactly how long will depend on the size of the artichokes prep time 5 mins cook time 40 minutes first place a steaming basket in a large pot and fill the pot with water until it reaches just under the basket place one layer of rinsed and trimmed artichokes into the steaming basket with artichoke stems facing up cover with lid on high heat bring the water in the steaming pot to a boil steam artichokes until they are tender cooking time can vary depending on the size of the artichokes a good approximation is 30 minutes for a mediumsized artichoke or 45 minutes for a jumbosized artichoke instructions 1 1 fill a medium saucepan with an inch of water and season it with a few pinches of salt 2 2 meanwhile trim the artichokes 3 3 place the artichokes stemend up in the steamer basket cover and steam for 20 minutes instructions 1 1 fill a medium saucepan with an inch of water and season it with a few pinches of salt 2 insert a steamer basket if the water comes up through the holes of the basket pour a little out 3 cover the pan and bring the water to a boil over high heat then reduce the heat to low and let the water simmer cover bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer cook for 25 to 45 minutes or until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off note artichokes can also be cooked in a pressure cooker about 1520 minutes cooking time cooking time depends on how large the artichoke is the larger the longer it takes to cook steam your artichokes for less cooking time and to preserve more of their nutrients 1 place a couple inches 4 cm of water into a pot to boil with a steaming basket on top 2 drop the artichokes into the pot once the water begins to boil and steam for 15 to 20 minutes 3 drain artichokes with the stem up before serving 1 place a couple inches 4 cm of water into a pot to boil with a steaming basket on top 2 add some lemon juice and salt to flavor the water if you prefer 3 drop the artichokes into the pot once the water begins to boil and steam for 15 to 20 minutes 4 1 3 place the artichokes stemend up in the steamer basket cover and steam for 20 minutes 2 check for doneness by pulling off an outer leaf from each and poking the base of the stems with a sharp knife—if the leaves come off easily and the knife slips easily into the base the artichokes are ready instructions 1 1 fill a medium saucepan with an inch of water and season it with a few pinches of salt 2 insert a steamer basket if the water comes up through the holes of the basket pour a little out 3 cover the pan and bring the water to a boil over high heat then reduce the heat to low and let the water simmer steaming arrange baby artichokes in a steamer insert or basket in a pot deep enough to keep the baby artichokes above water cover tightly and steam over rapid boiling water until baby artichokes are tender depending on size and quantity of baby artichokes steaming time can range from 15 to 20 minutes lift out carefully and drain microwaving arrange baby artichokes in a microwaveable bowl with about 12 inches of water
glucose glucose is a carbohydrate and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism glucose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates glucose is also sometimes called dextrose corn syrup is primarily glucose glucose is one of the primary molecules which serve as energy sources for plants and animals it is found in the sap of plants and is found in the human bloodstream where it is referred to as blood sugar the fasting blood glucose test is very important when it comes to determining certain medical conditions and people at risk for diabetes are particularly included in this category insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar glucose from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high hyperglycemia or too low hypoglycemia glucose is important to the body cecause it helps the reporduction of cells coposition of proteins and nucleic acids foundin all cells it helps growth and repairs tissues glucose is a carbohydrate and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism glucose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates glucose is also sometimes called dextrose corn syrup is primarily glucose glucose is one of the primary molecules which serve as energy sources for plants and animals it is found in the sap of plants and is found in the human bloodstream where it is referred to as blood sugar
kitchen fact the safe internal temperature for cooked chicken is 165° fahrenheit 75° celsius a meat or instantread thermometer is your best bet for determining the temperature of your chicken and if youre cooking a whole bird it should be inserted into the thickest part of the thigh but not touching bone if you handle chicken properly but cook it to a lower temperature you may be exposing yourself to a very slight risk of food poisoning but eating consistently tasty chicken we try never to roast a chicken beyond 160°f in the breast but that s our choice this goes to the very heart of the liberalconservative debate and as you can imagine it s not pretty our government says that you should cook a whole chicken until the temperature measured in the thigh is 180°f 82°c if you cook chicken pieces the government says the thigh wings and drumsticks should be 180°f while the breast should reach 170°f 77°c very generally you would let them cook for 45 minutes to an hour at 350 degrees f when checking chicken for doneness insert a knife or fork in the thickest portion of the … meat if it is done the juices will run out clear if not the juices will have a pinkish tinge and you should let them cook a little longer one and a half hours is much too long to cook the chicken at 350 degrees f the time your chicken will bake in the oven does depend on the internal temperature and the size of your chicken or chicken pieces generally i bake chicken at 350 degrees f for 30 to 40 minutes a cooking or meat thermometer should not be a sometime thing use it every time you prepare foods like poultry roasts hams casseroles meat loaves and egg dishes after desired cooking temperature is reached remove meat from heat source and let stand 10 to 15 minutes before carving cooking thermometers take the guesswork out of cooking as they measure the internal temperatures of your cooked meat poultry seafood baked goods andor casseroles to assure that a safe temperature has been reached harmful bacteria have been destroyed and your food is cooked perfectly checking the temperature of your cooked meat poultry and seafood with a food thermometer is the only reliable way to make sure your food has reached a safe internal cooking temperature

a minority discount is a percent reduction in the value of an interest that comprises only a minority of the corporations stock it is generally distinguished from a lack of marketability discount a somewhat similar percent reduction to account for the fact that the corporations stock is difficult to market the minority interest discount reflects the notion that a partial ownership interest may be worth less than its prorata proportional share of the total business for example ownership of a 30 share in the business may be worth less than 30 of the entire company value the lomd is in addition to any minority discount the two are taken not together but seriatim for example a 10 minority discount reduces an 100 share value to 90 and a further reduction by a lomd of 40 reduces the value to 54 90 x 1 04 54 the law in virginia is similar to that figure the expert applied a discount of 40 for lack of marketability and 30 for minority status that reduced the market value of the husband’s interest to 105177 the trial court rejected the husband’s reasoning for discounting for minority status and marketability minority interest in most situations a person owning a 100 would have a greater value for their interest than a person owning 51 not due to the fact that they own a larger percentage but that the price per share or unit would be higher this is because they have greater control” than a person with 51 there are many reasons why this is an imperfect measure of the minority discount but it is about the best source of observed market data available according to recent compilations of these control acquisitions the median implied minority discount is about 30 from the value of the stock for large companies minority interest discounta discount for lack of control applicable to a minority interest or an ownership interest less than 50 of the voting interest in a business enterprise the effect of applying a minority interest discount is to reduce the value of partial ownership interest below its proportional share of the business as an example discounting a 30 partnership interest by 20 would reduce its value to 24 of the overall business

are sometimes a first sign that someone has diabetes in prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes your cells become resistant to the action of insulin and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance instead of moving into your cells where its needed for energy sugar builds up in your bloodstream the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown what is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulinproducing cells in the pancreas this leaves you with little or no insulin type 2 diabetes diabetes is a disease in which the bodys blood glucose or blood sugar level is too high normally the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body the cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy over time however the body cant make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level diabetes is a leading cause of early death chd stroke kidney disease and blindness most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight eye disease caused by diabetes with increased blood sugar level gradually the eyes get damaged the most common eye disease caused due to diabetes is diabetic retinopathy retinopathy is considered an eye disease that causes decreased vision which gradually turns blurry and finally leads to blindness most diabetic patients are prone to heart diseases and stroke excess of sugar in the blood affects various body parts including the blood vessels such as the arteries capillaries and veins heart diseases result in the narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart brain or hands and legs 1 type 2 dm begins with insulin resistance a condition in which cells fail to

dynamic exercises involve concentric and eccentric contractions for example when you perform a biceps curl the action of curling the weight up is the concentric motion concentric contractions occur as a muscle shortens and generates force against a load to move it concentric contractions a concentric contraction is a type of muscle contraction where the length of the muscles shorten while undergoing tension for example when you pick up a curl bar and perform a biceps curl the length of your biceps muscles shorten your hands start down by your sides and ends with your hands up by your shoulders dynamic contractions assuming your talking about muscles refers to a contraction where by movement occurs like lifting a dumbbell from you side toward your shoulder static contractions refer to a contraction where no movement occurs also called isometric sources husband is a personal trainer with seven years experience and is currently completing a degree in exercise physiology beautyspot23 · 5 years ago isometric contractions an isometric contraction is a type of muscle contraction where the length of the muscle doesn’t change while undergoing tension an example of this would be if you were to take a 20 pound weight and perform a biceps curl and hold a position halfway between the repetition for 10 seconds a concentric contraction is a type of muscle contraction where the length of the muscles shorten while undergoing tension for example when you pick up a curl bar and perform a biceps curl the length of your biceps muscles shorten your hands start down by your sides and ends with your hands up by your shoulders dynamic contractionsisotonic contractions dynamic occur with movement or through the use of free weights when an athlete lifts a free weight they are exerting a force against gravity this contraction is often called an isotonic contraction this is inaccurate however as the muscle tension changes in relation to the angle of flexion and since the angle of flexion changes throughout the movement the tension cannot be equal throughout there are two types of dynamic contractions 1 concentric contractions 2 eccentr contractions that permit the muscle to shorten are referred to as concentric contractions an example of a concentric contraction in the raising of a weight during a bicep curl in concentric contractions the force generated by the muscle is always less than the muscles maximum p o as the load the muscle is required to lift decreases contraction velocity increases this occurs until the muscle finally reaches its maximum contraction velocity v max by performing a series of constant velocity shortening contractions a forcevelocity relationship can be determined a third type of muscle contraction isometric contraction is one in which the muscle is activated but instead of being allowed to lengthen or shorten it is held at a constant length an example of an isometric contraction would be carrying an object in front of you in concentric contractions the force generated by the muscle is always less than the muscles maximum p o as the load the muscle is required to lift decreases contraction velocity increases isokinetics is a type of dynamic exercise usually using concentric andor eccentric muscle contractions in which the speed or velocity of movement is constant and muscular contraction occurs throughout the full range of the movement nautilus machines are engineered to allow this type of contraction isotonic contractions are those which cause the muscle to change length as it contracts causing movement there are two types of isotonic contraction concentric a concentric contraction is a type of muscle contraction in which the muscles shorten while generating force during a concentric contraction a muscle is stimulated to contract according to the sliding filament mechanism types of contractions when we think of a muscle contracting normally we tend to think of the muscle shortening as it generates force while its true that this is a way of muscle contracting there are many different ways that a muscle can generate force as seen in figure 1 below in concentric contractions the force generated by the muscle is always less than the muscles maximum p o as the load the muscle is required to lift decreases contraction velocity increases

ovulation is also arrested in some women during the first 56 months of active breastfeeding leading to a larger stock of follicles at around the age of 45 years so pregnancy and breastfeeding are likely to delay the onset of the age of menopause for example let us assume that a daughter and her mother started menstruating when both of them were 12 years old taking birth control pills which prevent ovulation will also delay menopause birth control pills contain hormones that can block the process of oocyte maturation and ovulation this will again prevent decrease in the number of oocytes in the ovaries menopause is the period in a womans life when the ovaries stop releasing eggs and the uterus stops producing and expelling the lining that it makes monthly to support a fertilized egg this means the end of monthly menstruation and a whole new slew of symptoms such as hot flashes mood swings and vaginal dryness menopause symptoms may come on slowly although you have successfully delayed early onset menopause do not be ashamed of an occasional hot flash or mood swing realize that it is part of being a woman and you are simply entering a new phase of life with many benefits it should be noted that the average age for menopause is 51 and menopause can often last well into a woman’s 50s lateonset menopause refers only to the age at which menopause begins late menopause is not uncommon among obese women since fat can produce estrogen when a woman’s ovaries produce these hormones longer osteoporosis and heart problems seem to also be delayed because of this women with lateonset menopause actually tend to live longer although the normal age of menopause can vary anywhere between 45 years to 55 years the average age of menopause is 51 years surgical menopause of course can occur at any time the uterus is surgically removed taking birth control pills which prevent ovulation will also delay menopause birth control pills contain hormones that can block the process of oocyte maturation and ovulation this will again prevent decrease in the number of oocytes in the ovaries menopause is the point in time when a womans menstrual periods stop menopause happens because the ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone once you have gone through menopause you cant get pregnant anymore some people call the years leading up to a womans last period menopause but that time actually is the menopausal transition or perimenopause pereemenohpawz during the time of the menopausal transition perimenopause your periods can stop for a while and then start again pregnancy and delayed menopause in 2007 six out of every 10000 live births in the united states were to women age 50 to 54 a 5 percent increase from 2006 according to the national center for health statistics one group of women are at particular risk from late menopause these ladies have cumulative risks started with an early start of menstruation before age 12 they never had a fullterm pregnancy despite repeated attempts to conceive using fertility medications and then they went into menopause late pregnancy and lateonset menopause while it is still rare women are giving birth in their early 50s more than ever before this can delay menopause as a woman’s body adjusts to the hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy while it is rare for a woman over 50 to conceive and not miscarry any pregnancy at all has an impact on the woman’s hormonal level when a woman’s ovaries produce these hormones longer osteoporosis and heart problems seem to also be delayed because of this women with lateonset menopause actually tend to live longer it is the same hormonal imbalances in your body that cause late menopause however you may experience these changes late because of a genetic predisposition or because of environmental factors like excessive weight however all is not glorious in the garden of late blooming menopause having all of those hormones lingering around in your body can leave you vulnerable to attacks from a variety of different cancers including ovarian breast and uterine menopause is defined as the date 12 months after a womans last menstrual period the average age for american women to reach menopause is 51 with a normal range of 39 to 59 years of age at menopause estrogen production slows the earlier this occurs the greater the risk to the heart and bones one group of women are at particular risk from late menopause these ladies have cumulative risks started with an early start of menstruation before age 12 they never had a fullterm pregnancy despite repeated attempts to conceive using fertility medications and then they went into menopause late

we recommend a minimum of 7’ high fence for deer fence the cost averages as low as 020 a linear foot when purchasing economy fencing in quantities of 5000 linear feet or greater note that this price is for the net alone and excludes posts cables gates and accessories most fences to keep deer or elk inout are at least 8 some states have laws requiring deer farms to have fences 96 inches or higher a frightened animal will jump higher to escape than a calm one searching for food for a couple of years i had a 6 hot tape fence that i was told when i purchased it would keep the deer out not a chance ultimately i ended up taking the advice from a couple of other orchard folks bit the bullet and put up an 8 hightensile wire fence mounted to 5 posts spaced 16 apart in areas where such a tall fence is unsuitable for example on mountains subject to very high winds deer may be excluded or contained by a fence of ordinary height about 15 metres four feet with a smaller one of about one metre three feet high about one metre away from it on the same side as the deer total height of the fence should be at least 60 inches use wooden posts at least 6 inches in diameter and ten feet in length with approximately four feet buried in the ground for corner brace and riser posts the height of the fence should be 5 feet corner posts on small garden plots may be steel 133t type posts 7 feet long with at least 1 12 feet in the ground wooden corner posts are recommended for larger enclosures these should be at least 5 inches top diameter and sunk approximately 2 i put up a 6 foot fence with a 2 foot out leaning top i used 4 feet range fence then 4 feet on top i put 112 inch pvc over post then 45 on that and another foot pvc as deer haveto be close to jump the 45 acts as deturent like bookmark february 7 2014 at 723pm thank you for reporting this comment for a couple of years i had a 6 hot tape fence that i was told when i purchased it would keep the deer out not a chance ultimately i ended up taking the advice from a couple of other orchard folks bit the bullet and put up an 8 hightensile wire fence mounted to 5 posts spaced 16 apart there’s even evidence that a 6foot deer fence works most of the time some years back various connecticut towns banned all fencing over 6 feet high the local deer fence installers shook their heads but went ahead and installed a bunch of 6foot deer fences to their surprise the fences worked pretty well high enough to reliably keep out deer that’s not so high as you might think the literature says whitetailed deer can jump as high as 12 or even 15 feet but they generally don’t because nature tells them not to after all what goes up must come down and a deer with a broken leg is unlikely to survive a tall fence you can keep deer out of the garden with a fence that being said most deer can jump up to 8 feet of fence and some of the larger ones can sometimes clear 10 feet our particular fence is only 6 feet tall and to date we haven’t had any issues with deer jumping over the fences or walls around the handling facility must be of sufficient height that deer will not attempt to jump for most deer 25 m 8 is adequate but whitetailed deer and elk require at least 27 m 9 a bend or turn into the handling facility from the raceway is necessary to keep deer flowing just because you have a fence doesnt mean it will be effective at keeping out deer there are several facts you need to keep in mind when installing such a fence height or width is probably the most important factor with deer fences especially if high deer pressure whitetailed deer can jump almost eight feet high so effective upright fences against them should be this high deer may be able to jump high but not both high and over a distance so a fence may not be as high perhaps six feet but slanted outward the deer will try walking under the fence and meet resistance if you have a standard fence about four or five feet feet high you can add a similar and additional one about four feet away while not high with this width deer usually wont like to try and clear both and perhaps get caught between or on them
